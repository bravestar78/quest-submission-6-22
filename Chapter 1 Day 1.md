# 1. Block Chain

### Blocks filled with data that are linked to form a chain.  When each block is filled to capacity, it is linked to the previously filled block of data.  This forms a database where anyone can read and write data, that cannot be altered, that is not governed by anyone.

# 2. Smart Contract
 
### These are programs that provide guidelines/guardrails to allow people to interact with the blockchain in a predefined manner.  When the outlined conditions for the smart contract are met, the program runs and completes the task it was designed to complete.

# 3. Script v Transaction

### A script allows a user to view data on the Blockchain, and is free.  A transaction allows a user to use or call a function in a smart contract in order to change data on the Blockchain, and it is not free.
