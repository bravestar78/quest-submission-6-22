Resource Oriented Programming

# 2. Why would these pillars be useful

In order for developers to adopt the language and users to feel comfortable using DApps that are built on that language, ***safety and security*** are a necessity.
Having these as a foundational pillar aids in attracting and retaining developers as well as users.

Having ***clarity*** assists in making the language safe and secure.  When code has readability this allows for more effecient review, 
which helps developers when writing and verifying the code for bugs and/or safety.

With this language being new, having ***approachability*** aids in adoption.  
With similar syntax and semantics from other languages, this helps new developers get up and running quickly. 

Making ***developer experience*** a priority is an additional step to increase adoption of the language and attract developers to start using it.  
All in all it feels like these pillars are developer and user friendly and geared to foster growth and adoption of a new language

***Intuiting Ownership with Resources*** seems to share the theme of decentralization that blockchains covet.  
Because asset ownership is tied directly to each account by saving the resource in it's own storage this builds on efficiency and safety in the language.
